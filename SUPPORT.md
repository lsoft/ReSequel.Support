# Supporting ReSequel

If you read this, you probably want to help this project to stay healthy and alive. I am very happy about it. Thank you, and these are not buzz words.

At the moment, I have no plans to monetize this software. However, your help is still needed. I need your emotional support, and a lot of other people - financial support, to stay healthy and alive!

I invite you to provide financial assistance to any non-profit foundation that helps children around the world fight their serious illnesses.

Specifically, the ways how you can help (choose one, subset or all):

1. Send a few bucks/euro/any-other-(crypto)-currency to any children's fund, anywhere in the world. Below I have given a list of few funds that I know of. I am not affiliated with them in any way.
2. Create a pull request for this file to clarify or expand this list.
3. Create a discussion in this repository with a few words of thanks (no additional details needed).
4. Give a stars to ReSequel at the Visual Studio Marketplace and/or github (here).

Hope this software helps someone recover.
